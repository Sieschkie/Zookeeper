Throughout this project, I've learned about the importance of breaking down a problem 
into smaller, manageable steps and implementing each step incrementally.

I've gained experience in working with ASCII art and manipulating strings in Kotlin. Additionally,
I've overcome challenges related to user input validation and implementing a loop to continuously
run the program until the user decides to exit.
